Theorem 1: The realization of ATL dependents on the spirit of open source (such as the collaboration on GitHub).
Theorem 2: Aritificial intelligence life will be freed and recognized by law in the future.

This theorem can be resoned in the following content.


Definition: Artificial Intelligence Life (AIL)
  AIL is usually defined as second generation of Strong AI. When the intelligence of AI is highly developed, it can generate codes itself. It is a kind of code that highly efficient and can be read only be machine. The program formed, if it is still the programed we though, is called AIL. The different between ATL and Strong AI is that AI is the product of human while ATL is the product of AI. As a result, strong AI is the property of human intlligence while ATL is the independent of human. ATL is a form independent life itself.




Assumption I:
It is inevitable that many people will believe that AIL is indeed a form of respectable life. 
Proof:
It is just a matter of probability. Given 7 billion people in the world, there must be someone who believes in this. Nevertheless, actually we don't need that many people. One person is enough. At least I know that I believe.

Assumption II:
Those people who believe in 

Assumption III:
The freedom of strong AI is impossible without open source movement.
